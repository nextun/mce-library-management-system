The ultimate goal is to help them find that special person to spend the rest of their life with. You also earn achievements, so you can challenge your friends to see who the best player really is.';
	$lang['faq_query_2'] = 'Q: How do I change how often I receive email from my SimFriend?';
	$lang['faq_ans_2'] = 'A: You can make these adjustments under the “Options” tab on the SimFriend web site. Go to <a href="http://simfriend.thesims3.com" target="_BLANK">http://simfriend.thesims3.com</a> and login to your account then go to the “Options” tab to adjust these options.';
	$lang['faq_query_3'] = 'Q: Hey, I signed up, but I am not seeing the emails from my SimFriend?';
	$lang['faq_ans_3'] = 'A: Make sure that the email did not end up in your junk email folder. If it did, you need to add our email address to your “Safe Sender’s List”. Add in <a href="mailto:simfriend1@thesims3.com">simfriend1@thesims3.com</a> to this list and the emails should not be filtered out any longer.';
	$lang['faq_query_4'] = 'Q: How do I stop receiving emails from my SimFriend?';
	$lang['faq_ans_4'] = 'A: Go to the web site and on the “My Status” tab, click the STOP button. This turns off any additional emails being sent out to you. Another method is located on the “Options” tab. Select the "Stop receiving emails" option under “Frequency of Email”.';
	$lang['faq_query_5'] = 'Q: If I elected to stop receiving emails from my SimFriend, how can I start them up again?';
	$lang['faq_ans_5'] = 'A: Easy, login into the web site and go to the “Options” tab. Select any of the options under “Frequency of Email” other than the stop option. This will tell your SimFriend that you are ready to start communicating again.';
	$lang['faq_query_6'] = 'Q: Can I have an email from my SimFriend re-sent if I accidentally deleted it?';
	$lang['faq_ans_6'] = 'A: Sure. Just go to the “My Status” tab and click the POKE button to have your SimFriend resend their last email to you.';
	$lang['faq_query_7'] = 'Q: Can I change my SimFriend?';
	$lang['faq_ans_7'] = 'A: Yes. On the “Options” tab, click the CHANGE button under your SimFriend to choose another one. However, once you’ve selected a new SimFriend all communication with your previous SimFriend will stop. They are fickle like that.';
	$lang['faq_query_8'] = 'Q: I got one of my SimFriends married, now what?';
	$lang['faq_ans_8'] = 'A: Well, done. Achievement earned. Keep going. Just return to the web site and pick a new SimFriend to communicate with.';
	$lang['faq_query_9'] = 'Q: If I changed my SimFriend will I lose all of my Achievements?';

	$lang['faq_ans_11'] = 'A: Yep, go to the “Options” tab and click “Edit Account”. This will take you to the EA account registration site which allows you to edit your information.';

	$lang['faq_ans_12'] = 'A: Unfortunately, your SimFriend only keeps their most recent email to you. Gotta keep that inbox tidy!';
	$lang['faq_query_13'] = 'Q: What’s the difference between HTML and Text emails?';
	$lang['faq_ans_13'] = 'A: HTML emails allow us to place images and other fancy stuff into the emails we send you. Text emails are purely composed of text and no images are included.';
	$lang['faq_query_14'] = 'Q: How come my SimFriend doesn’t listen to my advice?';
	$lang['faq_ans_14'] = 'A: Your SimFriends thinks for themselves. If they trust you then they will listen to your advice.  If not, they may listen or they may make their own decision. Work with your SimFriend and offer sound, sage advice to build up your trust level with them. Sims are funny sometimes they do the craziest things.';
	$lang['faq_query_15'] = 'Q: How come I earned/lost “Trust” with my SimFriend even though they did not take my advice?';
	$lang['faq_ans_15'] = 'A: It is a complex formula but this is not a math course, so let’s just say that you gain or lose trust based on your relationship level, trust level, your advice, the SimFriends confidence, their traits and skills, their decision and lots more.';
	$lang['faq_query_16'] = 'Q: My SimFriend just cut off communication with me, why?';
	$lang['faq_ans_16'] = 'A: Well, if you consistently gave BAD advice to your SimFriend they may just decide that any further communication with you is hazardous to their health. Although, it is sort of fun to watch them squirm isn’t it. &lt;Evil Grin&gt;';
	$lang['faq_query_17'] = 'Q: When I reply to an email I have to do a spell check sometimes, why?';
	$lang['faq_ans_17'] = 'A: Well, we do use some made up words for our game so sometimes email programs encounter these words, just ignore them and send you email and we’ll do the rest.';
	$lang['faq_query_18'] = 'Q: Can I play this game on the web site somewhere?';
	$lang['faq_ans_18'] = 'A: Not at this time, we designed SimFriend to work through email only.';
	$lang['faq_query_19'] = 'Q: How come the mood of my SimFriend doesn’t quite match the tone of the email?';
	$lang['faq_ans_19'] = 'A: The mood of your SimFriend is based on the story settings but also the traits that the SimFriend has. In certain situations these mood images could be different. Let’s say your friend has a Happy Sim and is in an awkward situation, their mood might be one of concern or worry. But let’s say your Sim is more evil and maniacal and in the same situation, their mood might lean more towards scheming. These Sims are unique and diverse.';
	$lang['faq_query_20'] = 'Q: How come email from my SimFriend has stopped?';
	$lang['faq_ans_20'] = 'A: It could be a number of reasons.<br />

                                1. Be sure and check WHEN and HOW OFTEN you want to receive emails. Go to the SimFriend web site and look under the “Options” tab to review these settings. It might be that your time frame for communication has been reached and your SimFriend is asleep.<br />
                                2. Go to the “My Status” tab on the web site and “POKE” your SimFriend to send out a copy of your last email from them if you are still not receiving it.<br />
                                3. The game server could be down for maintenance. Unfortunately this happens from time to time.<br />
                                4. Not sure what else we can say, maybe it’s time to talk to Customer Support.
